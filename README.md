#### To-do
- [ ] Write function to parse local pcd file and create new pcd on local along with doing it on AWS.
- [ ] Add a requirements.txt file with all the necessary packages so as to ease the setting-up time of project
- [x] Add "how to setup & run" section.
- [ ] Add more To-dos (Lol!)


#### setting it up?
1. Enter your AWS KEYS in `functions.py`
2. Install all the dependencies.
3. run `python app.py`
4. visit `0.0.0.0:5000/segmentation?url=YOUR_URL&threshold=YOUR_THRESHOLD` on your browser.
